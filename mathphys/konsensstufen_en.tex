If there is a consent vote going on, you can indicate your opinion by raising a special amount of fingers.
\begin{description}
\item[1. Agreement without concerns] I like it.
\item[2. Agreement with small doubts] I am a bit sceptical, but in general I agree with the vote.
\item[3. Abstain] I do not want to participate in the voting process, but I will stick to the result.
\item[4. Standing aside] You can do that for sure, but I wont help you with it.
\item[5. Severe Reservation] Negative outcome of the vote! I think the proposal is crap.
\item[Raised Fist = VETO] Negative outcome of the vote! The proposal is against my ethics. Either it is withdrawn or i will leave the student council
