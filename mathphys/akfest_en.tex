\section{Das MathPhysTheo-Fest]
The MathPhysTheo-Party is \emph{the} greatest party organized only by students -- loud music, loads of alcohol, a bunch of diffrent people (and not only mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists) -- a \emph{must} go to for all party people. Its organized by the student councils of MathPhysInf and theology combined and is held once a term. The party takes place at \mathphystheotermin\. To get some rest after dancing, you can grab some beer for fair prices or alternatively sip a delicious cocktail and regain your strength by eating some chilli or baguettes.

As soon as you were there -- and as mentioned a lot of students belong into this group -- you can imagine how much work is put into this Project. Thats the job of the organizing group AK Fest. We are always in search for new helpers and intrested people! How the general things work generally at the party is a quite well tested system, but still every MathPhysTheo is new challenge for us. To recieve information about the working groups meeting dates you can simply come over at the student council room ( INF 205 1.301 ) or write an email to \email{akfest@mathphys.stura.uni-heidelberg.de}.

But not only for organisation purposes, also for simple voluntary shifts -- bar tendering, assembly and dismantling and many more things, we want \emph{YOU}! There will be lists in time at the student council rooms.
