\section{Arbeitsraum/Study Room}
\label{sec:arbeitsraum}
Since a couple of years, there is a supervised study room for physics students. We created this room primarily for you. What's great about it, is that there are tutors who help you with your problems and answer your questions. The concept is working well and we received a lot of positive feedback, especially regarding the tutors. Conceptvise it can be regarded as an additional tutorial where the tutors answer your questions, especially those that could not be answered during the regular tutorials can be discussed here. It's easy to lose sight of what's really important considering the huge amount of exercise sheets. That's exactly when older students can be huge help. They can also help you with your exercise sheets by providing useful advice. Obviously they shouldn't solve it for you, but support you on your way to the solution.

You can find the study room in the second floor of the KIP in front of the seminar rooms. During the lecture period a tutor will present Monday until Friday from 1 pm until 7 pm and on fridays until 5 pm. A huge poster will help you to recognize the tutor. In addition to a couple of standard books, there are a coffee maschine and an electric kettle providing you with coffee and tea to low prices.

So if you're ever desparing about an exercise sheet, just visit the study room and let the tutors help you.
